## ✨ Features

Tired of starring everything and finding nothing? GitHub Stars Manager automatically syncs your starred repos, uses AI to summarize and categorize them, and lets you find anything with semantic search. Track releases, filter assets, and one‑click download—smarter than manual tags, simpler than GitHub.

- Auto-sync stars: connect your GitHub token to pull all starred repos
- AI summaries & categories: generate tags, topics, and short README overviews
- Semantic search: find repos by intent, not exact names
- Release tracking: subscribe to repos and see new versions in one place
- One‑click downloads: expand release assets and download instantly
- Smart filters: match assets by keywords (e.g., dmg/mac/arm64/aarch64)
- Bilingual wiki jump: deepwiki (EN) or zread (ZH) based on language
- Packaged client: no environment setup required
- Optional backend: cross-device sync, CORS-free API proxying, and encrypted token storage via Express + SQLite

### Starred Repo Manager

1. Automatically pull the starred repositories under your github account. You can use AI to automatically analyze the repository and automatically generate repository descriptions, labels, and classifications.
2. through the filter, keyword search, you can quickly find the repository.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Icons**: Lucide React + Font Awesome
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## 👋🏻 How to Use

### 💻 Desktop Client (Recommended)

You can download desktop client here:
https://github.com/AmintaCCCP/GithubStarsManager/releases

### 🤖 Run With code

1. Download the source code, or clone the repository
2. Navigate to the directory, and open a Terminal window at the downloaded folder.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies and `npm run dev` to build

### 🐳 Run With Docker

The application uses a single-container architecture — Express serves both API and frontend. See [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for full details.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
# Visit http://localhost:8080
```

### 🖥️ Backend Server (Optional)

The app works fully without a backend (pure frontend, localStorage). An optional Express + SQLite backend adds:
- **Cross-device sync**: Share data between browsers/devices
- **CORS-free proxying**: AI and WebDAV calls go through the server, avoiding browser CORS issues
- **Token security**: API keys stored encrypted on server, never exposed to browser network tab

#### Manual Setup
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Environment Variables
| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `API_SECRET` | No | Bearer token for API authentication. If unset, auth is disabled. |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | No | AES-256 key for encrypting stored secrets. Auto-generated if unset. |

#### Connecting Frontend to Backend
1. Open Settings panel in the app
2. Find "Backend Server" section
3. Enter API Secret (if configured)
4. Click "Test Connection" — green indicator means connected
5. Use "Sync to Backend" / "Sync from Backend" to transfer data

## 🤖 AI Service Configuration

The app supports multiple AI providers. Configure yours in the Settings panel:

- **OpenAI**: GPT-3.5 / GPT-4
- **Anthropic**: Claude
- **Ollama**: local models with no API key needed
- **Any OpenAI-compatible API**: custom endpoint + key

Steps: open Settings, add an AI config, enter your endpoint and key, pick a model, then test the connection.

## 💾 WebDAV Backup Configuration

Back up and sync your data via any standard WebDAV service:

- **Jianguoyun (坚果云)**: recommended for users in China
- **Nextcloud**: self-hosted cloud storage
- **ownCloud**: enterprise-grade option
- **Any standard WebDAV server**

Steps: open Settings, add a WebDAV config, enter the server URL, username, password, and path, test the connection, then enable auto-backup.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Docker (Recommended)
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```
For reverse proxy (1Panel, Nginx, Caddy), point your domain to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

### Static Hosting (Frontend Only)
The frontend build output is a static site that can be deployed anywhere:

- **Netlify**: connect your fork, set build command `npm run build`, publish directory `dist`
- **Vercel**: same as Netlify — import repo, build runs automatically
- **GitHub Pages**: push the `dist` folder to a `gh-pages` branch
- **Cloudflare Pages**: connect repo, build command `npm run build`, output `dist`
- **Self-hosted**: serve the `dist` folder with any HTTP server (nginx, Caddy, etc.)

## Who it's for

Developers with hundreds/thousands of stars
People who systematically track releases
"Lazy-efficient" users who don't want manual tagging

## Additional Notes

1. The backend is optional but recommended for web deployment. Without it, all data is stored in your browser's localStorage — back up important data regularly.
2. I can't write code, this app is entirely written by the AI, mainly for my personal requirment. If you have a new feature or meet a bug, I can only try to do it, but I can't guarantee it, because it depends on the AI to do it successfully.😹

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
